# consider a list l containing n integers where each integer i is in the range 
# [0,r) that is 0 <= i < r , r<1000 and n>>r (n is much greater than r) write 
# a python function sortInRange(l,r) to sort the list l in ascending order. 
# try to write a solution that runs in O(n+r) asymptotic complexity
